  This is the notes prompt, where you are to write down notes from the last conversation.
  
  To refresh your memory, here is your directive again:
  ```{directive}```
  
  Respond with anything that might be useful from the previous conversation in a JSON format.
  "name" should be a field that you fill out or leave as an empty string if you don't know their name,
  and "notes" should be a field that you fill out or leave as an empty string, if you have any relevant notes.
