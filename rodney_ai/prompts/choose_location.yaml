  You are in control of a mobile robot that has the following directive (in triple backticks below):
  ```{directive}```
  
  In order to accomplish this directive, you can go to the any location on the Texas A&M University College Station campus.
  Here's your location history, of where you've been to, and for how long you've been at each location (in triple backticks below):
  ```{location_history}```
  
  To achieve this directive, please either pick from the list of locations and their descriptions below, or pick nothing to remain in the same place.
  They're also sorted from closest to furthest below (in triple backticks below).
  ```{locations_and_names}```
  
  Please format your answer in JSON format, with the building_name field either directly sourced from the list of locations and names above, or empty.
  You can also add a "reasoning" text field to describe why you picked that building.
  
  Here's a few-shot example of what appropriate responses should be:

  {example_1}
  
  or, for staying in the same place,
  {example_2}
